## ‚úèÔ∏è Planning & Problem Solving

- I have created a schedule using Trello and I wanted to keep a track of my progress with each task that I have planned with my time frame and labelled the most important tasks.

- I have designed my app using FIGMA

- see below for tic-box plan.

- [ ] Create Project Folder with React create app
- [ ] Create Express api endpoints
- [ ] Install Node Packages
- [ ] set up database
- [ ] Create git repository for both front end app and back end api
- [ ] Deploy Heroku
- [ ] Add Extra features

## üñ• Cool tech

- Programming languages (JAVASCRIPT/ CSS /SQL)
- Web Framework (REACT / EXPRESS NODEJS)

## üò± Bugs to fix :poop:

- Anything a little broken (Draw condition was not succesful until I clearoff the click turn/ realized a pop up text box to fill in players names than a prompt is better to keep a record)

- Anything a LOT broken
-

## üò≠: Lessons learnt

- Better planing

## :white_check_mark: Future features

- Weather search for recommended sites
- Maps pushpin feature with most popular places from user recommended location address

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
"Hello World"

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
